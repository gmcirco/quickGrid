# quickGrid

<!-- badges: start -->

`quickgrid` is a package intended to make it easy and fast to generate place-based crime predictions using a variety of spatial risk factors. Tools are included in this package to help speed up the processing of data (including calculating distance and density measures for spatial risk factors) and the fitting of models for prediction estimates. Currently, this package utilizes a gradient boosted tree model implementing the `lightgbm` package. A series of wrappers help users fit reasonable starting models using a cross-validated tuning grid. Much of the inspiration of this package comes from an earlier paper by [Wheeler and Steenbeck (2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-020-09457-7).

## Installation

You can install the released version of quickGrid from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("quickGrid")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gmcirco/quickgrid")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(lightgbm)
library(quickGrid)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
